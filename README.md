# Post App

This project is to design a app which allows us to post on timeline

## Features

In the app, you can:

### Navigate between different sections:

This app allows us to navigate between three different tabs, without reloading the page, with default tab as Home tab.

### `Add Post`

This allows us to write on dashboard and post it. Post will be visible on timeline

### `Delete Post`

You are free to make changes by Deleting the posts which are no furthur required

### `Edit Post`

You can also modify a previously posted item according to your needs

### `Upvote and Downvote`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `Upvote`, you canâ€™t decrease the number count!**

This allows to Upvote and Downvote a post simply by clicking the respective buttons. The numbers will increase consequently

## Alert Message

This feature allows to display an alert message at top of Home page, which is displayed when either post is added, edited or deleted.


### Sign-In

This is another tab where user can sign-in with the required credentials. Though this page isn't totally developed, so it won't work fully.

### Sign-Up

This is another tab, which will allow us to create a account after filling up the required credentials. Same as before, this page isn't totally developed, so it won't work fully.
